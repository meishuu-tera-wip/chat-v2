# Chat V2

So. Really not sure what this did.

Pretty sure it added timestamps and let you do some other stuff like chat from
an Electron window but it's been nearly 2 years. There's better ways to do
timestamps now anyway.

Started off in CoffeeScript, which I would later realize was a big mistake, but
the `web.js` here is just the compilation of `web.coffee`. It needs to be in JS
and not Coffee so `web` can run it.

Depends on the modules [`web`] and what was then-called [`scaleform`].
